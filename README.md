## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned laying out in flexbox , which is far better tha using floats in old days.

```css
.container-plan {
  align-items: center;
  align-self: center;
  background-color: var(--color-very-pale-blue);
  border-radius: 10px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 0 50px;
  width: 250px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to use flex and grid to laying out more components in future.
I felt the align keywords for flex and gris are pretty confusing and may need to get a hang of them.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9862167/positioning-div-element-at-center-of-screen) - This article helped me in identifying solution for making the card in centre irrespective of all screen sizes.
